## Limits and Continuity

Understand the behavior of functions as they approach specific points or infinity. Key topics:
- [:Limit Definition](#Limit-Definition)
- [:Continuity](#Continuity)
- [:L'Hôpital's Rule](#LHpitals-Rule)

## Limit Definition

In calculus, limits help us understand values that functions approach but don't necessarily reach. Learn to find [:limits of functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_of_a_function).

## Continuity

A function is continuous if it has no gaps or jumps. Check if a function is continuous by analyzing limits from both sides of a point.

## L'Hôpital's Rule

Use L'Hôpital's Rule to evaluate indeterminate forms like \( \frac{0}{0} \) or \( \frac{\infty}{\infty} \) by differentiating the numerator and the denominator.

## Differentiation

Differentiation finds the rate of change. Key applications:
- [:Power Rule](#Power-Rule)
- [:Product Rule](#Product-Rule)
- [:Chain Rule](#Chain-Rule)

## Power Rule

For any function \( f(x) = x^n \), the derivative \( f'(x) \) is \( nx^{n-1} \). This rule makes finding derivatives of powers of \( x \) straightforward.

## Product Rule

When differentiating a product of functions, use \( (f \cdot g)' = f' \cdot g + f \cdot g' \).

## Chain Rule

The Chain Rule is essential for functions composed of other functions: \( (f(g(x)))' = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x) \).

## Integration

Integration finds accumulated values like areas under curves. Key techniques:
- [:Fundamental Theorem of Calculus](#Fundamental-Theorem)
- [:U-Substitution](#U-Substitution)
- [:Integration by Parts](#Integration-By-Parts)

## Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

The theorem that links differentiation and integration, allowing us to evaluate definite integrals as \( F(b) - F(a) \).

## U-Substitution

Use \( u \)-substitution to simplify integrals by changing variables to match basic integration forms.

## Integration by Parts

When faced with the integral of a product, use \( \int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du \).

## Series and Sequences

Analyze the sum of terms in a sequence, particularly infinite series. Topics include:
- [:Convergence](#Convergence)
- [:Taylor Series](#Taylor-Series)
- [:Power Series](#Power-Series)

## Convergence

Learn when a series approaches a finite value as terms increase. Useful tests include the Ratio Test and the Alternating Series Test.

## Taylor Series

Express functions as an infinite sum of derivatives at a single point: 
\[
f(x) \approx \sum \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!} \cdot (x - a)^n
\]

## Power Series

A power series is a series of the form \( \sum c_n (x - a)^n \), representing functions as infinite polynomials.

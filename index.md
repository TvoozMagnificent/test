A [differential equation] is an equation that involves one or more [functions] and their [derivatives]. It describes how a particular [quantity] changes in relation to other quantities. In simpler terms, it expresses a relationship between the rate of change of a [variable] and the variable itself.

For example, a simple [differential equation] could look like:

$$ \frac{dy}{dx} = 3x $$

This equation states that the [derivative] of the function $y$ with respect to $x$ (the rate of change of $y$ with respect to $x$) is equal to 3 times $x$.

There are two main types of [differential equations]:

1. **[Ordinary differential equations]** ([ODEs]): These involve functions of a single independent variable, like $y(x)$, and their [derivatives]. For example:

   $$ \frac{dy}{dx} + y = 0 $$

2. **[Partial differential equations]** ([PDEs]): These involve functions of multiple independent variables, like $u(x, t)$, and their [partial derivatives]. For example:

   $$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = D \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} $$

A [solution] to a differential equation is a function (or a set of functions) that satisfies the equation when substituted into it. Solving a differential equation involves finding this [function] or [set of functions].

Differential equations are used extensively in fields like [physics], [engineering], [economics], and [biology] to model dynamic systems, such as the motion of objects, population growth, or the spread of diseases. The [solutions] can often describe how a system behaves over time or space, depending on the context.

A [differential equation] is an equation that involves [functions] and their [derivatives]. It expresses a relationship between a [dependent variable] and one or more of its [independent variables], where the rate of change of the dependent variable is connected to the current state of the dependent variable itself or other variables. The primary goal is often to find the [function(s)] that satisfy the equation.

In a [differential equation], the [derivative] represents how a [function] changes with respect to the [independent variable]. For example, a simple first-order [differential equation] might take the form:

$$ \frac{dy}{dx} = f(x, y) $$

where $$ \frac{dy}{dx} $$ is the derivative of the dependent variable $$ y $$ with respect to the independent variable $$ x $$, and $$ f(x, y) $$ is some function of $$ x $$ and $$ y $$.

The solution to a [differential equation] is typically a [function] that satisfies the equation, meaning that if you plug it into the equation, both sides will balance. [Ordinary differential equations] (ODEs) involve only one independent variable, while [partial differential equations] (PDEs) involve multiple independent variables.

For instance, in physics, [differential equations] are often used to model the behavior of physical systems, such as the motion of objects, heat distribution, or the flow of electricity. The solution of such equations can provide [models] for how the system evolves over time or space.
